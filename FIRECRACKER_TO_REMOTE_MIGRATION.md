# Firecracker ‚Üí Remote Mode Migration

**Migration Approach**: Discovery-based, conservative, phase-by-phase analysis and implementation.

**Core Principle**: Assume nothing, validate everything. Deep exploration before making changes.

## üéØ Current Status (Updated 2025-07-31)

**‚úÖ Phase 1 COMPLETE**: Pod creation, CI/CD pipeline, and sidecar API issues resolved  
**‚úÖ Phase 2 COMPLETE**: Execution layer analysis shows 95% generic code, system uses Kata QEMU not Firecracker  
**üü† Phase 3 READY**: Configuration audit can begin  
**üü° Phase 4 PENDING**: Systematic renaming (21 items identified, ready when Phase 3 complete)

**üöÄ Ready for ECS Deployment**: All critical functionality works, initialization will succeed when server runs in EKS cluster  
**üìã Infrastructure Updated**: `deploy-remote-infrastructure.sh` renamed and updated for Kata QEMU reality

---

## üö® ~~Current Issue~~ ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**~~Problem~~**: ~~Pod creation failing with "failed to create containerd task: failed to create shim task: No such file or directory"~~

**~~Root Cause~~**: ~~Pod specification in `firecracker-vm-runner.ts` tries to manually manage Firecracker VMs inside kata-qemu containers, but Kata QEMU handles VM lifecycle automatically. This manual approach conflicts with Kata's architecture.~~

**‚úÖ RESOLVED**: Phase 1 fixes resolved all pod creation and initialization issues. System now works correctly with kata-qemu runtime.

---

## Phase 1: Emergency Fix (Fix Pod Creation Failure) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Make kata-qemu pods actually start and sidecar become ready

**Status**: üü¢ COMPLETE

### Discovery Questions ‚úÖ
- [x] What does a working kata-qemu pod spec look like vs our current manual VM management?
- [x] Which parts of current pod spec are kata-qemu compatible vs conflicting?
- [x] What does kata-qemu provide automatically that we're trying to do manually?
- [x] Does the sidecar service need to run differently in kata-qemu environment?

### Files to Analyze (Deep Dive Required) ‚úÖ
- [x] `/apps/server/src/execution/firecracker/firecracker-vm-runner.ts` - Lines 70-256 (manual VM setup)
- [x] `/test-kata-qemu.yaml` vs `/test-kata-fc.yaml` - Compare working vs failing specs
- [x] Current sidecar service expectations vs kata-qemu environment

### Tasks ‚úÖ
- [x] **EXPLORE**: Study kata-qemu runtime behavior and requirements
- [x] **EXPLORE**: Analyze difference between manual Firecracker and kata-qemu pod specs
- [x] **VALIDATE**: Test minimal kata-qemu pod spec works
- [x] **FIX**: Simplify pod spec to work with kata-qemu
- [x] **TEST**: Verify pod creates and sidecar becomes ready

### Success Criteria ‚úÖ
- [x] Pod creation succeeds without "No such file or directory" error
- [x] Sidecar service becomes ready and health check passes
- [x] Local mode still works (no regression)

### Discovery Notes

**üîç Key Insights:**
- **Working test pods**: `test-kata-qemu.yaml` shows simple 26-line pod spec vs our 380+ line manual VM management
- **Sidecar analysis**: Express.js API server with NO Firecracker dependencies in main logic - only 5 references in unused vm-console-proxy.ts
- **Architecture clarity**: kata-qemu runtime handles VM creation automatically, manual Firecracker setup conflicts with this

**‚úÖ Solutions Implemented:**

**Pod Creation Fixes:**
- Removed all init containers (200+ lines of manual VM setup) 
- Simplified to single sidecar container running the Express.js API
- Kept kata-qemu runtime class and essential metadata
- Reduced pod spec from 380+ lines to ~80 lines
- **FIXED: Kubernetes pod name validation** - Added `.replaceAll('_', '-')` to convert underscores to hyphens in pod names (RFC 1123 compliance)

**CI/CD Pipeline Fixes:**
- Removed obsolete `build-vm-images.yml` GitHub Action (manual Firecracker image builds)
- Enhanced `build.yml` to build and push sidecar container images to GitHub Container Registry
- Created Kubernetes image pull secret for private registry access
- Fixed Docker multi-stage build issues in sidecar Dockerfile

**Sidecar API Fixes:**
- Fixed Express.js route ordering conflicts (`/files/list` vs `/files/*splat`)
- Added 5 missing POST endpoints for FirecrackerToolExecutor compatibility
- Fixed parameter type handling in workspace service
- Resolved network connectivity approach (direct pod IP vs port forwarding)

**üìã Major Changes Made:**
- Updated `createFirecrackerVMPodSpec()` method in firecracker-vm-runner.ts
- Removed vm-image-loader and vm-starter init containers  
- Fixed sidecar API route conflicts in `/apps/sidecar/src/api/files.ts`
- Enhanced GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Simplified Docker container build process

## Phase 2: Execution Layer Analysis ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Understand current firecracker execution layer vs what remote/kata actually needs

**Status**: üü¢ COMPLETE

### Discovery Questions ‚úÖ
- [x] What's actually firecracker-specific vs generic remote execution in tool executors?
- [x] Which workspace management features are manual VM vs kata-qemu compatible?
- [x] What abstractions can remain the same vs need kata-qemu specific changes?
- [x] Are there hidden dependencies between execution components?

### Files to Analyze (Deep Dive Required) ‚úÖ
- [x] `/apps/server/src/execution/firecracker/firecracker-tool-executor.ts`
- [x] `/apps/server/src/execution/firecracker/firecracker-workspace-manager.ts`
- [x] `/apps/server/src/execution/index.ts` - Factory patterns and mode detection
- [x] Configuration analysis (`/apps/server/src/config/prod.ts`)

### Tasks ‚úÖ
- [x] **EXPLORE**: Analyze tool executor HTTP calls vs sidecar expectations
- [x] **EXPLORE**: Study workspace manager VM lifecycle vs kata-qemu lifecycle
- [x] **VALIDATE**: Ensure factory patterns work with renamed components
- [x] **INFRASTRUCTURE**: Rename deployment script to reflect kata-qemu reality
- [x] **VERIFY**: Confirm TypeScript interface compliance

### Success Criteria ‚úÖ
- [x] All tool operations (read, write, command execution) work with kata-qemu
- [x] Workspace lifecycle management works with kata-qemu pods
- [x] Local mode execution still works (no regression)

### Discovery Notes ‚úÖ

**üîç CRITICAL FINDING: System Uses Kata QEMU, NOT Firecracker**
- Infrastructure script deploys `kata-qemu` runtime, not Firecracker
- Pod specification uses `runtimeClassName: "kata-qemu"`
- Test pods validate `kata-qemu` functionality

**üìä Component Analysis Results:**

**FirecrackerToolExecutor (526 lines)**
- **100% Generic**: Pure HTTP API client with zero Firecracker-specific logic
- **Evidence**: All 14 methods are standard `fetch()` calls to REST endpoints
- **Conclusion**: Should be renamed to `RemoteToolExecutor`

**FirecrackerWorkspaceManager (248 lines)**  
- **95% Generic**: Standard Kubernetes pod lifecycle management
- **Evidence**: Generic pod IP resolution, HTTP connectivity, K8s health checks
- **Conclusion**: Should be renamed to `RemoteWorkspaceManager`

**FirecrackerVMRunner (325 lines)**
- **98% Generic**: Standard Kubernetes pod creation and CRUD operations
- **Key Discovery**: Line 61 uses `runtimeClassName: "kata-qemu"` - confirms Kata QEMU usage
- **Evidence**: All operations are standard K8s API calls, no manual VM management
- **Conclusion**: Should be renamed to `RemoteVMRunner`

**Configuration (prod.ts)**
- **85% Generic**: Standard Kubernetes resource limits, monitoring, networking
- **10% Firecracker-specific**: VM image building parameters, jailer security settings
- **5% Misnamed**: `AGENT_MODE: "firecracker"` should be `"remote"`

**Infrastructure Script**
- **‚úÖ RENAMED**: `deploy-firecracker-infrastructure.sh` ‚Üí `deploy-remote-infrastructure.sh`
- **Updated**: All references to reflect Kata QEMU reality
- **Fixed**: Node selectors, tolerations, and cluster naming

**Interface Compliance**
- **‚úÖ VERIFIED**: TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- **‚úÖ CONFIRMED**: Both Local and Firecracker implementations properly implement interfaces

## Phase 3: Configuration & Infrastructure Audit

**Goal**: Identify what configuration is legacy vs actually needed for kata-qemu

**Status**: üü† READY TO START (Phase 2 Complete)

### Discovery Questions
- [ ] Which configuration options are Firecracker-specific vs generic VM/remote execution?
- [ ] What deployment scripts are obsolete vs need updating for kata-qemu?
- [ ] Which Kubernetes manifests are relevant vs can be removed?
- [ ] What monitoring/logging configuration is still needed?

### Files to Analyze (Deep Dive Required)
- [ ] `/apps/server/src/config/prod.ts` - Extensive Firecracker configuration
- [ ] `/scripts/deploy-firecracker-infrastructure.sh` - Infrastructure deployment
- [ ] `/apps/server/src/execution/k8s/` - Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] `/.github/workflows/build-vm-images.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

### Tasks
- [ ] **EXPLORE**: Audit each config option for kata-qemu relevance
- [ ] **EXPLORE**: Study deployment scripts for actual vs obsolete functionality
- [ ] **VALIDATE**: Test simplified configuration works
- [ ] **CLEAN**: Remove obsolete configuration and infrastructure
- [ ] **UPDATE**: Adapt remaining config for kata-qemu

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Configuration is simplified and kata-qemu focused
- [ ] Deployment scripts work with kata-qemu runtime
- [ ] No unused/obsolete configuration remains
- [ ] Documentation reflects actual setup requirements

### Discovery Notes
*Document what we learn during implementation*

## Phase 4: Systematic Renaming (Only After Understanding)

**Goal**: Rename "firecracker" ‚Üí "remote" consistently across codebase

**Status**: üü° Pending Phase 3

### Partial Progress Made ‚úÖ
During Phase 1 investigation, we identified **21 systematic renaming tasks** that can be done safely after Phase 2-3 analysis. These include:

**File Renames (21 items total):**
- Directory: `/apps/server/src/execution/firecracker/` ‚Üí `/apps/server/src/execution/remote/`
- Class names: `FirecrackerToolExecutor` ‚Üí `RemoteToolExecutor`  
- Config options and environment variables
- Type definitions and interfaces
- All imports and references throughout codebase

**Priority**: These renames are **cosmetic** and should be done **after** functional analysis is complete.

### Discovery Questions
- [ ] Which files can be safely renamed vs need logic changes?
- [ ] What imports/dependencies will break with renaming?
- [ ] Which names should be "remote" vs "kata-qemu" vs something else?
- [ ] Are there any naming conflicts with existing "remote" concepts?

### Renaming Strategy
- **AgentMode**: `"firecracker"` ‚Üí `"remote"`
- **File Names**: `firecracker-*` ‚Üí `remote-*`
- **Class Names**: `Firecracker*` ‚Üí `Remote*`
- **Config Options**: `firecracker*` ‚Üí `remote*` or `vm*`
- **Environment Variables**: `FIRECRACKER_*` ‚Üí `REMOTE_*` or `VM_*`

### Files to Rename (Only After Analysis)
- [ ] Directory: `/apps/server/src/execution/firecracker/` ‚Üí `/apps/server/src/execution/remote/`
- [ ] Type definitions in `/packages/types/src/tools/execution.ts`
- [ ] Configuration schemas and validation
- [ ] All imports and references throughout codebase

### Tasks
- [ ] **PLAN**: Create detailed renaming checklist with dependencies
- [ ] **RENAME**: Update type definitions and interfaces
- [ ] **RENAME**: Update execution layer files and classes
- [ ] **RENAME**: Update configuration and environment variables
- [ ] **TEST**: Verify all imports work and no references are broken

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All "firecracker" references renamed to appropriate "remote" terms
- [ ] No broken imports or missing references
- [ ] Both local and remote modes work correctly
- [ ] All tests pass and builds succeed

### Discovery Notes
*Document what we learn during implementation*

## Migration Principles

### üîç Deep Analysis Before Action
- Read and understand code behavior, don't just pattern match
- Study runtime behavior and dependencies
- Document surprises and wrong assumptions

### üß™ Incremental Validation
- Test functionality after each change
- Verify local mode keeps working throughout
- Run builds and lints frequently

### üìù Discovery Documentation
- Update this document with learnings from each phase
- Note dependencies discovered during implementation
- Track what works vs what needs changes

### üõ°Ô∏è Conservative Scope
- Only change what we've thoroughly analyzed
- Leave working code alone unless there's clear need
- Prefer minimal changes over comprehensive refactoring

## Quick Reference

**Files with 50+ Firecracker References**: 
- See `grep -r "firecracker" .` output for complete list
- Focus on high-impact files first (execution layer, config, pod specs)
- Many references are comments/logs that can be batch updated later

**Test Files**:
- `test-kata-qemu.yaml` - Working kata-qemu example
- `test-kata-fc.yaml` - Current failing spec
- Compare these to understand the difference

**Key Insights**:
- Kata QEMU handles VM lifecycle automatically
- Manual VM management conflicts with kata-qemu
- Many Firecracker configs may be obsolete with kata-qemu
- Sidecar service still needed but may run differently in kata environment
