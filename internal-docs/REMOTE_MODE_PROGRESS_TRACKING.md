# Shadow System Remote Mode Progress Tracking

## Current Status: ~96% Complete ‚úÖ

Full dual-mode execution architecture with remote Kubernetes integration, complete git-first architecture parity, enhanced terminal system with buffering, and unified sidecar client architecture. Remote mode now has full feature parity with local mode and is production-ready.

- Testing implementations with network latency simulation

### **Phase 3: Sidecar Service** ‚úÖ
- Complete Express.js REST API with file operations, command execution, directory operations
- Server-Sent Events streaming support and health checks
- Docker containerization with Turborepo optimization
- Graceful shutdown and process management

### **Phase 4: Remote Mode Integration** ‚úÖ
- **RemoteToolExecutor**: HTTP client with exponential backoff, circuit breaker, graceful fallbacks
- **RemoteWorkspaceManager**: Kubernetes pod lifecycle management with health monitoring
- Database integration with remote initialization steps (`CREATE_POD`, `WAIT_SIDECAR_READY`, etc.)
- Production configuration with K8s manifests, RBAC, monitoring hooks

### **Phase 5: Git-First Architecture** ‚úÖ
- **Complete sidecar git API**: Clone, commit, push, branch, status, diff, config endpoints
- **Remote workspace manager git integration**: Shadow branch creation, cleanup commits
- **Chat service remote mode support**: Automatic commits after LLM responses
- **Full feature parity**: Remote tasks survive pod restarts with git persistence

### **Phase 5.5: Unified Sidecar Client** ‚úÖ

- **Connection management**: History replay on reconnection, buffer persistence across restarts
- **Production APIs**: Terminal history, stats, clear, and streaming endpoints with SSE
- **Real-time synchronization**: WebSocket error handling and state recovery

### **Phase 6.5: Filesystem-First Architecture** ‚úÖ
- **Eliminated FileChange database table**: Replaced with real-time filesystem watching
- **Socket.IO-based watching**: Captures ALL changes (tools, scripts, builds, manual edits)
- **Git-based history**: On-demand diff computation, reduced database complexity
- **Cross-platform support**: Works in both local and remote execution modes

## üî• Future Architecture: Firecracker Integration (Phases 7-9)

### **Phase 7: VM Image Creation & Infrastructure**
**Target Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

Replace Docker containers with Firecracker microVMs for enhanced security isolation:

**7.1 Base VM Image Development**
- [ ] Create Ubuntu 22.04 LTS root filesystem image (300-400MB compressed)
- [ ] Pre-install core runtimes: Node.js 20, Python 3.11
- [ ] Pre-install LSP servers: typescript-language-server, pylsp
- [ ] Include essential tools: git, curl, ripgrep, build-essential
- [ ] Compile Shadow sidecar service as optimized binary
- [ ] Store in ECR with versioned tags (`shadow-vm:v1.0.0`)

**7.2 Kubernetes Node Preparation**
- [ ] Create Firecracker DaemonSet for Nitro instances (m5/c5)
- [ ] Configure node labels (`firecracker=true`) and taints
- [ ] Mount `/dev/kvm` via privileged sidecar containers
- [ ] Update RBAC for VM pod creation permissions

**7.3 Configuration Extensions**
- [ ] Add Firecracker config options to `apps/server/src/config.ts`:
  - `FIRECRACKER_ENABLED: boolean`
  - `VM_IMAGE_REGISTRY: string`
  - `VM_IMAGE_TAG: string`
  - `FIRECRACKER_KERNEL_PATH: string`

### **Phase 8: VM Communication & Lifecycle**
**Target Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

**8.1 VM Console Proxy Architecture**
- [ ] Create `apps/sidecar/src/services/vm-console-proxy.ts`
- [ ] Implement serial console (ttyS0) read/write operations
- [ ] Protocol multiplexing: raw terminal vs JSON messages
- [ ] Message framing with prefixes (`TERM:`, `JSON:`, `EXEC:`)
- [ ] Maintain existing sidecar HTTP API as facade

**8.2 VM Lifecycle Management**
- [ ] Create `apps/server/src/services/firecracker-manager.ts`
- [ ] VM creation with kernel + rootfs image loading
- [ ] Resource allocation: 1 vCPU, 1-2GB RAM (auto-scaling)
- [ ] Workspace volume mounting via virtio-fs
- [ ] Health monitoring and VM recovery logic

**8.3 Enhanced RemoteWorkspaceManager**
- [ ] Extend `createAgentPodSpec()` for Firecracker mode
- [ ] Add privileged container spec with `/dev/kvm` mount
- [ ] Feature flag implementation (`FIRECRACKER_ENABLED`)
- [ ] Backward compatibility with Docker mode

### **Phase 9: Development Experience & Production Hardening**
**Target Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

**9.1 LSP Integration & Resource Management**
- [ ] Add LSP management to VM image startup script
- [ ] Create `apps/sidecar/src/services/lsp-manager.ts`
- [ ] Extend sidecar API with `/diagnostics` endpoints
- [ ] Implement memory auto-scaling (1GB ‚Üí 2GB) for large builds
- [ ] Add resource usage monitoring via VM metrics

**9.2 Error Handling & Observability**

- [ ] Console log aggregation and structured logging

**9.3 Migration Strategy**
- [ ] A/B testing with percentage-based task allocation
- [ ] Performance and stability monitoring
- [ ] Gradual rollout alongside existing Docker deployments
- [ ] Health dashboard for Firecracker node status

## üöÄ Current System Status

**Production Ready**: The system is fully functional as a coding agent platform with complete local/remote mode parity, git-first architecture, enhanced terminal streaming, and unified client architecture.

**Remaining Work (4%)**:
- **Production Deployment (2%)**: Helm charts, CI/CD, image registry, environment promotion
- **Operational Monitoring (1.5%)**: Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing, alerting rules
- **Enhanced Testing (0.5%)**: End-to-end K8s validation, load testing, chaos engineering

The current Docker-based remote mode provides the core functionality. Firecracker integration (Phases 7-9) will add enhanced security isolation while maintaining all existing capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Firecracker Implementation Strategy
