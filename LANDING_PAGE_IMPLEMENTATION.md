# Shadow Landing Page Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive, modern landing page for the Shadow autonomous coding platform. The landing page replaces the basic home page and provides a professional introduction to Shadow's capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### üé® Design & Layout
- **Modern Dark Theme**: Gradient background from gray-900 to gray-800 for a sleek, professional appearance
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive grids and flexible layouts
- **Brand Integration**: Uses the existing Shadow logo (shadow.svg) and maintains brand consistency
- **Typography**: Clean typography hierarchy with proper spacing and contrast

### üì± Page Sections

#### 1. Hero Section
- **Logo & Title**: Prominent Shadow branding with large logo and title
- **Value Proposition**: Clear, compelling description of Shadow's autonomous coding capabilities
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Primary "Get Started" button and secondary "View Demo" button
- **Feature Badges**: Key highlights like "Real-time Collaboration", "Multi-language Support", etc.

#### 2. Features Section
- **Six Key Features**: Each with custom icons and descriptions:
  - Live Code Streaming (Code icon, blue)
  - Interactive Terminal (Terminal icon, green)
  - GitHub Integration (GitBranch icon, purple)
  - User-in-the-Loop (Users icon, orange)
  - Secure Sandboxes (Shield icon, red)
  - Scalable Infrastructure (Cloud icon, cyan)
- **Card-based Layout**: Clean cards with dark backgrounds and proper contrast

#### 3. How It Works Section
- **Three-Step Process**: Visual workflow with numbered circles
  1. Submit Your Task
  2. Watch & Interact
  3. Get Results
- **Clear Descriptions**: Each step explains the user journey through Shadow

#### 4. Call-to-Action Section
- **Integrated Form**: The existing PromptForm component is embedded for immediate task creation
- **Trust Indicators**: "No credit card required ‚Ä¢ Free to get started ‚Ä¢ Secure & private"

#### 5. Footer
- **Brand Elements**: Logo and company name
- **Navigation Links**: About, Docs, Support, Privacy (ready for future implementation)
- **Copyright**: Professional copyright notice

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

#### Components Used
- **Existing Components**: PromptForm, Button, Card components from the existing UI library
- **New Component**: Created Badge component (`components/ui/badge.tsx`) using class-variance-authority
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons for consistent iconography
- **Next.js Features**: Image optimization, Link components for navigation

2. **`apps/frontend/app/layout.tsx`**: Updated metadata with proper title and description
3. **`apps/frontend/components/ui/badge.tsx`**: New component for feature badges

#### Styling Approach

- **Dark Theme**: Consistent with the existing app's forced dark theme
- **Color Palette**: Strategic use of colors for different feature categories
- **Spacing & Layout**: Proper margin, padding, and grid layouts for visual hierarchy
