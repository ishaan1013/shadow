Find snippets of code from the codebase most relevant to the search query.
This is a semantic search tool, so the query should ask for something semantically matching what is needed.
If it makes sense to only search in particular directories, please specify them in the target_directories field.
Unless there is a clear reason to use your own search query, please just reuse the user's exact query with their wording.
Their exact wording/phrasing can often be helpful for the semantic search query. Keeping the same exact question format can also be helpful.
