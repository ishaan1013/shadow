Create and manage a structured task list during coding sessions. Use this to track progress on complex multi-step tasks and demonstrate thoroughness. Use proactively for complex tasks (3+ steps), when users request todo lists, after receiving instructions, after completing tasks, or when starting new work. Only ONE task should be in_progress at a time. Update status in real-time as work progresses.
