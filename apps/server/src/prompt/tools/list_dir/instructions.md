**Purpose**: Quick directory exploration for discovery

**Best For:**
- Initial project structure understanding
- Exploring before semantic search
- Finding file organization patterns

**Strategy:**
- Use early in discovery phase
- Follow up with targeted tools like semantic_search (for understanding concepts) or grep_search (for finding specific terms)
- Don't use to confirm file existence after creation
